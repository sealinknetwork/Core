             The BlockPolicyEstimator is used for estimating the feerate needed
             for a transaction to be included in a block within a certain number of
             blocks.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             At a high level the algorithm works by grouping transactions into buckets
             based on having similar feerates and then tracking how long it
             takes transactions in the various buckets to be mined.  It operates under
             the assumption that in general transactions of higher feerate will be
             included in blocks before transactions of lower feerate.   So for
             example if you wanted to know what feerate you should put on a transaction to
             be included in a block within the next 5 blocks, you would start by looking
             at the bucket with the highest feerate transactions and verifying that a
             sufficiently high percentage of them were confirmed within 5 blocks and
             then you would look at the next highest feerate bucket, and so on, stopping at
             the last bucket to pass the test.   The average feerate of transactions in this
             bucket will give you an indication of the lowest feerate you can put on a
             transaction and still have a sufficiently high chance of being confirmed
             within your desired 5 blocks.
            
             Here is a brief description of the implementation:
             When a transaction enters the mempool, we
             track the height of the block chain at entry.  Whenever a block comes in,
             we count the number of transactions in each bucket and the total amount of feerate
             paid in each bucket. Then we calculate how many blocks Y it took each
             transaction to be mined and we track an array of counters in each bucket
             for how long it to took transactions to get confirmed from 1 to a max of 25
             and we increment all the counters from Y up to 25. This is because for any
             number Z>=Y the transaction was successfully mined within Z blocks.  We
             want to save a history of this information, so at any time we have a
             counter of the total number of transactions that happened in a given feerate
             bucket and the total number that were confirmed in each number 1-25 blocks
             or less for any bucket.   We save this history by keeping an exponentially
             decaying moving average of each one of these stats.  Furthermore we also
             keep track of the number unmined (in mempool) transactions in each bucket
             and for how many blocks they have been outstanding and use that to increase
             the number of transactions we've seen in that feerate bucket when calculating
             an estimate for any number of confirmations below the number of blocks
             they've been outstanding.
            
             We will instantiate an instance of this class to track transactions that were
             included in a block. We will lump transactions into a bucket according to their
             approximate feerate and then track how long it took for those txs to be included in a block
            
             The tracking of unconfirmed (mempool) transactions is completely independent of the
             historical tracking of transactions that have been confirmed in a block.
            
              We want to be able to estimate feerates that are needed on tx's to be included in
             a certain number of blocks.Every time a block is added to the best chain, this class records
             stats on the transactions included in that block

            <remarks>
            We have to lump transactions into buckets based on feerate, but we want to be able
            to give accurate estimates over a large range of potential feerates.
            Therefore it makes sense to exponentially space the buckets.

             <remarks>
            
             TxMempool stores valid-according-to-the-current-best-chain transactions
             that may be included in the next block.
            
             Transactions are added when they are seen on the network(or created by the
             local node), but not all transactions seen are added to the pool.For
             example, the following new transactions will not be added to the mempool:
             - a transaction which doesn't make the mimimum fee requirements.
             - a new transaction that double-spends an input of a transaction already in
             the pool where the new transaction does not meet the Replace-By-Fee
             requirements as defined in BIP 125.
             - a non-standard transaction.
            
             <see cref="P:Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempool.MapTx"/>, and <see cref="T:Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempoolEntry"/> bookkeeping:
            
             <see cref="P:Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempool.MapTx"/> is a collection that sorts the mempool on 4 criteria:
             - transaction hash
             - feerate[we use max(feerate of tx, feerate of Transaction with all descendants)]
             - time in mempool
             - mining score (feerate modified by any fee deltas from PrioritiseTransaction)
            
             Note: the term "descendant" refers to in-mempool transactions that depend on
             this one, while "ancestor" refers to in-mempool transactions that a given
             transaction depends on.
            
             In order for the feerate sort to remain correct, we must update transactions
             in the mempool when new descendants arrive. To facilitate this, we track
             the set of in-mempool direct parents and direct children in <see cref="!:mapLinks.Within"/>
             each TxMempoolEntry, we track the size and fees of all descendants.
            
             Usually when a new transaction is added to the mempool, it has no in-mempool
             children(because any such children would be an orphan).  So in
             <see cref="M:Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempool.AddUnchecked(Blockcore.NBitcoin.uint256,Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempoolEntry,System.Boolean)"/>, we:
             - update a new entry's setMemPoolParents to include all in-mempool parents
             - update the new entry's direct parents to include the new tx as a child
             - update all ancestors of the transaction to include the new tx's size/fee
            
             When a transaction is removed from the mempool, we must:
             - update all in-mempool parents to not track the tx in setMemPoolChildren
             - update all ancestors to not include the tx's size/fees in descendant state
             - update all in-mempool children to not include it as a parent
            
             These happen in <see cref="M:Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempool.UpdateForRemoveFromMempool(Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempool.SetEntries,System.Boolean)"/>.
             (Note that when removing a
             transaction along with its descendants, we must calculate that set of
             transactions to be removed before doing the removal, or else the mempool can
             be in an inconsistent state where it's impossible to walk the ancestors of
             a transaction.)
            
             In the event of a reorg, the assumption that a newly added tx has no
             in-mempool children is false.  In particular, the mempool is in an
             inconsistent state while new transactions are being added, because there may
             be descendant transactions of a tx coming from a disconnected block that are
             unreachable from just looking at transactions in the mempool(the linking
             transactions may also be in the disconnected block, waiting to be added).
             Because of this, there's not much benefit in trying to search for in-mempool
             children in <see cref="M:Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempool.AddUnchecked(Blockcore.NBitcoin.uint256,Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempoolEntry,Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempool.SetEntries,System.Boolean)"/>.
             Instead, in the special case of transactions
             being added from a disconnected block, we require the caller to clean up the
             state, to account for in-mempool, out-of-block descendants for all the
             in-block transactions by calling <see cref="M:Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempool.AddTransactionsUpdated(System.Int32)"/>.  Note that
             until this is called, the mempool state is not consistent, and in particular
             <see cref="F:Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempool.mapLinks"/> may not be correct (and therefore functions like
             <see cref="M:Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempool.CalculateMemPoolAncestors(Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempoolEntry,Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempool.SetEntries,System.Int64,System.Int64,System.Int64,System.Int64,System.String@,System.Boolean)"/>
             and <see cref="M:Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempool.CalculateDescendants(Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempoolEntry,Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempool.SetEntries)"/> that rely
             on them to walk the mempool are not generally safe to use).
            
             Computational limits:
            
             Updating all in-mempool ancestors of a newly added transaction can be slow,
             if no bound exists on how many in-mempool ancestors there may be.
             <see cref="M:Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempool.CalculateMemPoolAncestors(Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempoolEntry,Blockcore.Features.MemoryPool.TxMempool.SetEntries,System.Int64,System.Int64,System.Int64,System.Int64,System.String@,System.Boolean)"/>
             takes configurable limits that are designed to
             prevent these calculations from being too CPU intensive.
            
             Adding transactions from a disconnected block can be very time consuming,
             because we don't have a way to limit the number of in-mempool descendants.
             To bound CPU processing, we limit the amount of work we're willing to do
             to properly update the descendant information for a tx being added from
             a disconnected block.  If we would exceed the limit, then we instead mark
             the entry as "dirty", and set the feerate for sorting purposes to be equal
             the feerate of the transaction without any descendants.
