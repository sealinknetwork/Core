            <summary>
            Feature for cold staking which eliminates the need to keep the coins in the hot wallet.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>In order to produce blocks on Stratis network, a miner has to be online with running
            node and have its wallet open. This is necessary because at each time slot, the miner is
            supposed to check whether one of its UTXOs is eligible to be used as so-called coinstake kernel
            input and if so, it needs to use the private key associated with this UTXO in order to produce
            the coinstake transaction.</para>
            <para>The chance of a UTXO being eligible for producing a coinstake transaction grows linearly
            with the number of coins that the UTXO presents. This implies that the biggest miners on the
            network are required to keep the coins in a hot wallet. This is dangerous in case the machine
            where the hot wallet runs is compromised.</para>
            <para>Cold staking is a mechanism that eliminates the need to keep the coins in the hot wallet.
            With cold staking implemented, the miner still needs to be online and running a node with an open
            wallet, but the coins that are used for staking can be safely stored in cold storage. Therefore
            the open hot wallet does not need to hold any significant amount of coins, or it can even be
            completely empty.</para>
